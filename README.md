#### Sev-C (6 hours, business hours)
- CFOâ€™s laptop seems a bit slow.
    - Error limits the funcionality or usefulness of the services, but the condition is not critical to the continued operation of the service. A workaround is readily available and can be applied or used with little to no operational impact.
